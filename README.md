# 🧮 Tkinter Calculator

A stylish and functional calculator application built using Python's `tkinter` library. This GUI-based calculator handles basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced operations like square root and squaring.

## ✨ Features

* ✅ **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
* ✅ **Advanced Functions**: Square root and square
* ✅ **Input Validation**: Error handling for invalid expressions
* ✅ **GUI Interface**: Built with `tkinter` using a pastel pink theme
* ✅ **Responsive Layout**: Buttons resize with the window

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 3
* **GUI Framework**: tkinter
* **Math Operations**: Built-in `math` and `eval()` for expression evaluation

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarinaDoolub/tkinter-calculator.git
   cd tkinter-calculator
   ```

2. **Run the calculator**

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

> ✅ **Note**: Requires Python 3.x installed on your system.

## 🧠 How It Works

* Inputs are entered via GUI buttons.
* The `eval()` function handles expression evaluation.
* Additional math functions (sqrt, power) are processed using Python’s `math` module.
* Errors are caught and displayed through popup messages.


## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Dark mode toggle
* History log of calculations
* Keyboard support for faster input
* Support for more scientific functions
